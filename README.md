# Give automatic ratings
A neural network which will rate a movie ( out of 5 stars ) based on your given review

# How to use
Simply run `train.py` with argument `--rev` as your review
Example: `python train.py --rev "worst movie ever"`

Sorry for not making checkpoint file this time, so yeah it'll train everytime before predicting.
But you can improve this project by adding checkpoints
